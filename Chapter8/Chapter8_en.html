    <div>
        <h2>Process </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A running program</li>
            <li>System Process: Performing functions required for Unix operation</li>
            <li>User Processes: Processes Executed by Users</li>
            <li>If you terminate the process, the child processes are terminated as well.</li>
            <li>You need to know the PID or process name when you exit the process.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Type</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Daemon: A process run by the Unix kernel that provides specific services</li>
            <li>Parents, children, orphans, and zombies: Parents create children, and children return the results to their original parents. If the parent is terminated during execution, it is called orphan, and the orphan process is called the first process is the new parent, and the parent process is called the zombie process if the system resources are not recovered even if the child process is terminated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Command</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>View process list: ps, pgrep</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Foreground Processing</h3>
      Processing method in which no other commands can be entered because the prompt is not output until the user-entered command is executed and the result is output (normal processing
      <h3>Background Processing</h3>
      When the command is finished, the next prompt will be printed, regardless of the result, allowing you to enter another command (and attach it to the end of the command)
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Job Control Command – jobs</h2>
      <ul>

          <li>- If you specify a specific task number, only the information for that task is output</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Work number</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>It increases sequentially every time you run it in the background with a task number.[1],[2],[3] …</li>
          <li>% number: Outputs task information for that number</li>
          <li>%+ or %%: Outputs task information with a task order of +</li>
          <li>%- : Outputs task information with task order –</li>
          <li>+ is the most recent approach task - + just before </li>
          <li>Status of operation: Running, Done, Terminated, Stopped</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Switch and Shut Down Task Commands</h3>

          <li>ctrl + z or stop [% job number] : Stop foreground work. (Not End, but Suspended)</li>
          <li>bg[% job number]: Converts the job indicated by the job number into a background job.</li>
          <li>fg [% job number]: Converts the job indicated by the job number to a foreground job.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>noohup command&</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Keep running background tasks after logging out</li>
          <li>When you log out, all running tasks end</li>
          <li>Execution results and error messages: Save to nohup.out file</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>View user information</h2>
      <ul>
